Essentially, I was presented with a wooden box containing 14 smaller wooden boxes of varying sizes and shapes - some of them were cubes, while others were not. My objective was to fit all the smaller wooden boxes neatly inside a larger wooden box, ensuring that there was no wasted space.

While one could certainly attempt to solve this problem manually by trying out different combinations, I opted to develop a program to tackle it instead. By doing so, I was able to simplify the process and more efficiently arrive it a viable solution.

A special thanks goes to [NoRelect](https://norelect.ch) who gave me this task and helped me to achieve my first result. Also thank you to J.L who even got a faster working solution in Python and removed all the Object instantiations.
